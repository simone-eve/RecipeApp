# RecipeApp

## Description

My Recipe App is a C# .NET7 console application that allows users to store and manage details about their favourite recipe. With this app users can easily add ingredients, add steps, view the whole recipe, scale the ingredient quantities, descale the ingredient quantities, and delete their recipes details.

### Motivation

The motivation of creating this application was so that everyday users aren’t plagued by forgetting family recipes or any recipe that struck something in them. It is also a great beginner for people learning to take an interest in baking and/or cooking.

## Features

1. Add a new recipe with the recipe name, ingredients (name, quantity and unit of measurement) and steps (description) .
2. View a list of all the recipe details.
3. Scale a recipe up or down by specifying a factor of either 0.5, 2 or 3.
4. De-scale a recipe to its original quantity.
5. Delete a recipe.
6. Exit

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-recipe-app.git
2. Open the application in Visual Studio (Downloadable at: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
3. Ensure you are using .NET 7.
4. Run the application by pressing the green play button.

## Usage

>When you run the application you will be prompted to enter the recipes name, enter as such. Next you will be prompted with a menu where you can select various options to alter/add to your recipes. To add the details to your recipe select option 1 and enter the recipe details which will include the ingredients details (name, quantity and unit of measurement) and the steps details (step description). To view a list of all your recipes details, select option 2. To scale a recipe, select option 3. Thereafter you will be prompted on whether you would like to scale it to 0.5, 2 or 3.  To descale a recipe, select option 4 and the application will automatically descale the quantity to it's original value. To delete a recipe select option 5, the application will confirm whether you would like to delete the recipe and if you confirm it will be deleted. Finally, you will be able to return to the enter recipe name prompt and then the main menu and input the details for a new recipe.
