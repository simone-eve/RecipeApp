# RecipeApp
Description
My Recipe App is supposed to help users to store details about their recipes 
along with edited them in many ways such as: add ingredients, view the recipe, scale the recipe, descale the recipe and delete it. After the user inputs the 
data about thier recipe it is then stored in Lists. These lists are used to store data and then later manipulate and/or view it.
